# Class 4: PostgreSQL Views, Temporary Tables, and Functions

This class covers essential PostgreSQL features for data manipulation and organization, focusing on views, temporary tables, and built-in functions commonly used in web development.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Views and Temporary Tables

- Basic Views

  - Creating simple views for data abstraction
  - Views with calculations and aggregations
  - Complex views joining multiple tables
  - Updatable views with CHECK OPTION
  - Materialized views for performance optimization

- Temporary Tables
  - Creating and using temporary tables
  - Complex calculations using temporary tables
  - Combining views with temporary tables
  - Practical examples (monthly reports, budget analysis)

### 2. Built-in Functions

- String Functions

  - LENGTH, TRIM, UPPER/LOWER
  - String concatenation
  - Substring operations
  - Pattern replacement

- Numeric Functions

  - Basic math operations (ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR)
  - Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - Calculations and conversions

- Date/Time Functions

  - Current date/time retrieval
  - Date calculations and intervals
  - Date part extraction
  - Date formatting

- Conditional Functions

  - COALESCE for handling NULL values
  - NULLIF for comparison
  - GREATEST and LEAST
  - CASE expressions

- Type Conversion Functions
  - Converting between data types
  - Formatting numbers and dates
  - Safe type casting

### 3. Common Function Use Cases

- Sales Analysis

  - Daily sales summaries
  - Product performance metrics
  - Revenue calculations

- Customer Insights

  - Email domain analysis
  - Purchase history tracking
  - Customer segmentation

- Inventory Management

  - Stock level monitoring
  - Sales vs. stock analysis
  - Inventory alerts

- Date-based Analysis

  - Sales by day of week
  - Monthly trends
  - Time-based reporting

- Text Analysis
  - Pattern matching
  - String manipulation
  - Data cleaning

## Practice Examples

The class includes practical examples using a sample database with:

- Products and Orders
- Sales and Inventory
- Customer Data
- Transaction Records

Each example demonstrates real-world scenarios commonly encountered in web applications.

## Key Takeaways

1. Views provide:

   - Data abstraction
   - Security layer
   - Complex query simplification
   - Consistent data representation

2. Temporary Tables are useful for:

   - Complex calculations
   - Intermediate result storage
   - Performance optimization
   - Multi-step data processing

3. Built-in Functions offer:

   - Efficient data manipulation
   - Standardized calculations
   - Data type handling
   - Date/time management

4. Best Practices:
   - Use views for frequently accessed queries
   - Leverage temporary tables for complex operations
   - Choose appropriate functions for data manipulation
   - Consider performance implications
   - Document complex views and calculations
